# Saferoom
Encryption extension to Evernote and Onenote platforms

# NOTE:

This is a forked repository, simply so that I could manage and untrack files, e.g. config.ini which 
were added to the original repo prior to their `.gitignore` file being updated.  

To ensure you have the latest code, please track the [original](https://github.com/saferoom-app/saferoomlinux).

## Getting started
Now, let's download the Saferoom application and start it on local machine

Clone this repository and start the server:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/saferoom-app/saferoomlinux
cd saferoomlinux
python server.py
```

If everything is ok, you should see the following:
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
```

Now open your browser and type the following address:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
You should see Saferoom main page

## Generating master password

Before generating the master password, please check [this](http://help.getsaferoom.com/2015/03/28/saferoom-concepts/). 
Summarizing, the **Master password** is the password that you use to encrypt and decrypt your data. This password **is stored on your local PC and never sent anywhere**

**OTP or One-Time password** is the password that is used to encrypt/decrypt specific note. This password can be useful when you want to share the encrypted note with someone you know and you don't want to compromise your **Master password**

Master password is generated using small CLI utility. To generate the master password, please navigate to Saferoom app root folder and type the following:

```
python passwd.py
```

Then follow the intructions

# Evernote
This section contains necessary instructions how to connect Saferoom App to your Evernote account

## Getting developer token
To interact with Evernote API Saferoom app needs the developer token. This token for your specific account can be generated [here](https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action)

If you're not logged in, you need to login with your account. After you receive the developer token, open **config.ini** file in application root folder, find section **[tokens]** and paste your developer token as the following:
```
[tokens]
evernote_developer = <developer_token>
 ...
```
Save **config.ini**, open main Saferoom page and click Evernote icon in the upper-right corner of the page. If everything is OK, then you will see the basic info about your account.

# Onenote
This section contains instructions how to connect Saferoom app to your Onenote account

## Getting Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI
Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI are required to authtenticate Saferoom app into your Onenote account. 

Please follow the steps below to get Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI:

1. Go to [Windows Live application management site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070)
2. Sign in with your Windows Live ID (Microsoft Account)
3. If credentials are OK, you will be redirected to Application Registration portal
4. Click **Add an app** button
5. In the **New Application Registration** window type your Application Name
6. When the application will be created, you will be redirected to Application configuration page
7. **Client ID** will be in **Application ID** section
8. In **Application Secrets** click **Generate new password**. New window with **Client Secret** opens
9. Click **Add Platform**. Then select **Web**
10. In the Redirect URIs type your Redirect URI. This URI should match the following pattern: **https://[hostname]:5000/onenote/callback**. **"<hostname>"** can be any hostname, because it will be bound to **http://127.0.0.1** or **https://localhost**. By default app includes the certificates for **www.saferoomapp.com** hostname, so as the Redirect URI you can use the following URI: **https://www.saferoomapp.com:5000/onenote/callback**
11. Click **Save** button in the page bottom

## Configuring Saferoom application
Next step is to add these values to Saferoom configuration. It can be done in two ways:

- Open **config.ini** file in the root folder and paste these values as the following:
```
[tokens]
client_id = <your_client_id>
client_secret = <your_client_secret>
...
[uris]
redirect_uri = <your_redirect_uri>

```

## Configuring HTTPs
Since the Onenote API requires that your Redirect URI should be only HTTPs connection, we need to configure your Redirect URI and HTTPs. If you're using the default hostname (https://www.saferoomapp.com), then you need to skip this section, because by default Saferoom includes two SSL certificates (**server.key** and **server.crt**) binded to **www.saferoomapp.com** hostname. If you're using custom hostname, then you need to generate the SSL certificate for your local server. Please follow these steps (for demonstration we will be using **www.saferoomapp.com** as a hostname):

1. Open **/etc/hosts** file and add your **hostname**. This hostname must be resolved into 127.0.0.1 address. For example:
     
     ```
     vi /etc/hosts
      127.0.0.1 www.saferoomapp.com
     ```
     
2. Check that your hostname is resolved into 127.0.0.1 address. Open your terminal and ping your hostname. If everything is fine you should see the following output:
     
     ```
     PING www.saferoomapp.com (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
     64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.041 ms
     64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.045 ms
     ```
     
3. If you're using **www.saferoomapp.com** as your hostname, then skip this section and go section **5**
4. Using **OpenSSL** utility generate self-signed certificate using the following command:
     
     ```
     openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
     ```
     This command will generate the certificate (server.crt) and private key (server.key). Option **-nodes** is used not to protect your private key with the password. Since you will be using these certificate and key only in local environment, you should not worry about security. 
     
     After you issue this command, system will prompt you to fill some values. Since this is just a local certificate, you can use default values. The most important is **CN** or **Common Name** field. For this field you should specify the hostname, you're using for your Redirect URI. For example, if you're using **www.myapp.com** as a hostname, so the **CN** value should be **www.myapp.com** or **\*.myapp.com**

5. Import **server.crt** into the list of Trusted Certificate Authorities. For every this procedure may vary. Here is the example, how to do in Chrome on Ubuntu Desktop:
   1. Open your Chrome browser
   2. Open **Settings** > **Show advanced settings** > ** Manage certificates **
   3. Select **Authorities** tab. Click **Import**
   4. Select your generated **server.crt** and import it to browser
   5. Restart your browser
   6. Start Saferoom app (python server.py) and type in your browser: **https://www.saferoomapp.com:5000/**. Theoretically you shouldn't see any security warnings. However on some browsers you can see Security Exception, because they just don't allow Self-Signed certificates. In such cases just confirm security exception and add it to Exceptions list

7. Open **server.py** file, navigate to bottom and comment this line:
     
     ```
     app.run()
     ```
     Uncomment the following lines:
     ```
     context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
     context.load_cert_chain('server.crt', 'server.key')
     app.run(ssl_context=context)
     ```

6. Copy **server.crt** and **server.key** to Saferoom root folder. Please don't change names, because they're hardcoded in the application code. However if you want use other names, then you need to open **server.py**, navigate to bottom and modify the following line:
     
     ```
     context.load_cert_chain('server.crt', 'server.key')
     ```


## Connecting Saferoom app to your Onenote account
This sections contains steps, necessary to connect Saferoom application to Onenote account. The steps are the following:

1. Start Saferoom app and navigate to its main page
2. Click **Settings** button and check **Onenote** section. **Client ID** and **Client Secret** sections should be **OK** and Redirect URI field should contain your **Redirect URI**. Otherwise go to **https://[your_hostname]:5000/install** and configure all necessary values
3. Click the **Onenote** icon in the upper right corner of page. Onenote modal window appears
4. Click **Login** button. Microsoft registration page opens
5. Type your username and password. For some reason, you will the same the page with error message, that your password or username are not corrent. Ignore this and click **Sign In** once again. Saferoom wil authenticate into your Onenote account and get Access and Refresh Tokens. Since Access Token expires every 1 hour, Refresh token is used to get a new Access Token
